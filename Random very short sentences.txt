He was sleeping.
We were eating.
The sky was blue.
She was dancing.
You were swimming.

I was thinking.
He was climbing.
The birds were singing.
We were flying.
You were jumping.
She was running.
He was cooking.

The leaves were falling.
We were camping.
You were skating.
They were playing.
He was flying.
She was shopping.
I was watching.
The stars were shining.
We were cheering.
You were dreaming.
They were running.
He was laughing.
She was crying.
I was sleeping.
The wind was blowing.
We were walking.
You were eating.
They were swimming.
He was singing.
She was reading.
I was writing.
The grass was green.
We were talking.
You were playing.
They were working.
He was jumping.
She was dancing.
I was dreaming.
The waves were crashing.
We were riding.
You were fishing.
